1. Git is a version control system.
2. Git helps to keep track of code changes.
3. Git is used to collaborate on code (multiple people can work on code).
4. Git is installed locally on your computer.
   4.1 Install Git on your computer.
   4.2 Open cmd and set your username using `git config --global user.name "yourname"`.
   4.3 Set your email using `git config --global user.email "youremail"`.
5. GitHub is a cloud-based service that runs Git.
6. GitHub has alternatives that run Git.
   6.1 Bitbucket
   6.2 GitLab
7. Git also has alternatives.
8. Create a GitHub account on github.com.
9. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `example`).
10. Create a new file (e.g., `new.txt`).
11. Add some content to `new.txt`.
12. Commit changes and add a commit message (e.g., "New file created").
13. Create a folder (e.g., `github`).
14. Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and open the folder you created.
15. To bring the repository (e.g., `example`) created on GitHub to VSCode, use `git clone https://github.com/sudharsonj/intern.git`.
16. The link is copied from GitHub's "Code" option.
17. Change the directory from `github` to `example` using `cd example`.
18. Now you can see the file (`new.txt`) you created on GitHub in VSCode.
19. Create a new file (`new2.txt`) in VSCode.
20. When you create `new2.txt`, it shows "U," meaning the file is untracked.
21. To change the file from untracked to staging, use `git add new2.txt`. The "U" will change to "A".
22. Commit the file using `git commit -m "commit message"`.
23. After committing, push the file (`new2.txt`) to the repository on GitHub.
24. To push, you need to know the origin branch where the file should be pushed.
25. To know the branch name, use `git branch`.
   25.1 When multiple branches exist, use `git branch -a` to view the branch list.
   25.2 To change the branch name, use `git branch -m branchname`.
   25.3 To switch branches, use `git checkout branchname`.
   25.6 To merge branches, use `git merge branchname`.
26. After knowing the branch name, use `git push origin master`.
27. Now the file (`new2.txt`) is added to the GitHub repository, and you can view it there.
28. When you modify an already pushed file in VSCode, it shows "M," meaning the file is modified.
29. After making changes, follow the same steps (Add, Commit, Push) to update the repository with modifications.
30. When you create a new file (`new3.txt`) in the repository, use `git pull` in the VSCode terminal to see the newly created file in VSCode.
